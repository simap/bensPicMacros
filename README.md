bens PIC macros
=================

Working with PIC assembly can be pretty fun, but sometimes making up names for loop/condition labels and keeping track is just a pain. So I wrote this macro library that lets you write nested IF blocks, just like C or other languages.

About
==============

This is a runtime if macro library. It compiles into
real run-time evaluated nested if blocks. I use it for
just about everything and I hope you will too.

I tried to use nomenclature similar to mchips
ie ifzf - check for z in f, not iffz - check f for z

the skipping instructions have an 'if' eqivelent
ie btfss gains an 'if' but loses a 'skip' to become 
ifbtfs or simply ifbtf but remember that:
* btfss skips if true
* 'if' doesnt skip if true
